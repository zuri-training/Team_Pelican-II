## Starting the Project

From our understanding, we are creating a platform which allows users to create feedback forms to be embedded in their platforms.

Unauthenticated users (unregistered) can browse through  the platform to view basic information about the platform before being prompted to sign up/sign in while authenticated users can create new feedback forms, customize their forms from available templates as they like and, embed the feedback form in different formats.
Authenticated users will also have the ability to save data and come back to download and to see usage examples of different forms
 
We also decided that this service we are creating will be open to users who are looking for how to easily and effectively create forms to use for their platforms.


## End Goal
A responsive web-based platform that allows users to create feedback forms to be embedded in their platforms.
