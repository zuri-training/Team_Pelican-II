## Starting the Project

From our understanding, we are creating a platform which allows users to create feedback forms to be embedded in their platforms.

Unauthenticated users (unregistered) can browse through  the platform to view basic information about the platform before being prompted to sign up/sign in while authenticated users can create new feedback forms, customize their forms from available templates as they like and, embed the feedback form in different formats.
Authenticated users will also have the ability to save data and come back to download and to see usage examples of different forms
 
We also decided that this service we are creating will be open to users who are looking for how to easily and effectively create forms to use for their platforms.


## End Goal
A responsive web-based platform that allows users to create feedback forms to be embedded in their platforms.

## Process

From the brief, we gathered that we were:
Creating a platform that allows users to create feedback forms to be embedded in their platforms.

Unauthenticated users (unregistered) can browse through the platform before being prompted to onboard while authenticated users can interact with the documentation, create new feedback forms, customize their forms from available templates and embed the feedback form in different formats.

Authenticated users will also have the ability to save data and come back to download.

## Features

Customization Features: We will provide template customization settings for our users to dictate how they want their form to look like based on their brand

Different form formats: Users can embed the feedback form in different formats (link and shortcode)

Responsiveness : The web application is responsive on both the desktop and the mobile screen to ensure a smooth user experience.

## The Design Team

In order to understand our project better we carried out these activities to identify the best user interface and user experience for users of feedback_gen

* Research on other feedback generator platforms 
* Moodboards
* CTAâ€™s 
* Creation of User flows
* Style guides

All of which can be accessed using the link below:
* Figma link: 
* GitHub repo for feedback_gen: [click here](https://github.com/zuri-training/Team_Pelican-II.git) 

We are working on the design sketch, wireframing, low-fi, hi-fi and prototyping next for this project.

### Designers' Tool of Choice

The designers chose to work using "Figma" as its collaborative nature makes it easy to keep track of task statuses and make
corrections when necessary. 

## The Developers Team

The Developers were responsible for creating the logic behind the functionalities of the website as well as bringing the designs produced by the Design team to life.
